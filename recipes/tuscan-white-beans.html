        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A decadent, creamy side dish that's elevated with fried fresh sage to be the perfect crunch, delicate bliss. It seems too simple to be amazing but truly, it is!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups dried great northern or cannellini beans</li>
            <li>7 cups water</li>
            <li>3/4 tablespoon coarse kosher salt</li>    
            <li>4 cloves garlic unpeeled</li>
            <li>3 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>bundle of fresh sage leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>    
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>This recipe can be made with your instant pot (pressure cooker) or on the stovetop. For instant pot, add beans (unsoaked), water, salt, garlic, bay leaves, and 3 sprigs fresh sage to the cooking pot.</li> 
            <li>Set to manual high pressure for 30 minutes. Let come to pressure and cook. When finished, let pot natural release for 20 minutes, then finish releasing steam manually.</li>
            <li>If you are cooking the beans on the stovetop, plan on soaking beans overnight in refrigerator. When ready to make, add beans, water, salt, garlic, bay leaves, and 3 sprigs fresh sage to the cooking pot. On a low simmer, cook until beans are plump and tender, but not mushy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a small skillet and turn to medium heat. Once hot, add sage leaves, individually, and capers. Let cook for a few minutes on each side, turning over as they cook until crispy. Place sage and capers on a napkin.</li>
            <li>Drain beans, reserving 1 cup broth. Add beans and broth to a serving bowl, and pour olive oil over the top, and adorn with fried sage leaves and capers. Finish with flaky salt and cracked black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
